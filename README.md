## Hangman

A command line version of the [Hangman game](1).

This project utilizes serialization and file I/O, allowing the player to save their game at any point during play, to return later. The target word is generated randomly from [this dictionary file](https://www.scrapmaker.com/view/twelve-dicts/5desk.txt).

Play the live version on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@bchalman/hangman)
